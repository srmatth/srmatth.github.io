&lt;p>Exploration and modeling of a new large auto insurance data set provided by the CAS.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-availability">Data Availability&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The data used in this paper were obtained from the Casualty Actuary Society (CAS).

&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This paper explores the tuning and results of two-part models on rich datasets provided through the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). These datasets include bodily injury (BI), property damage (PD) and collision (COLL) coverage, each documenting policy characteristics and claims across a four-year period. The datasets are explored, including summaries of all variables, then the methods for modeling are set forth. Models are tuned and the tuning results are displayed, after which we train the final models and seek to explain select predictions. Data were provided by a private insurance carrier to the CAS after anonymizing the dataset. These data are available to actuarial researchers for well-defined research projects that have universal benefit to the insurance industry and the public. Our hope is that the methods demonstrated here can be a good foundation for future ratemaking models to be developed and tested more efficiently.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>mSHAP: SHAP Values for Two-Part Models</title><link>https://srmatth.github.io/papers/mshap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://srmatth.github.io/papers/mshap/</guid><description>&lt;!--

&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>mSHAP values can be used to gain insights on variable importance when using two-part models that are commonly used in insurance modeling.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;font size=3>
Two-part models are important to and used throughout insurance and actuarial science. Since insurance is required for registering a car, obtaining a mortgage, and participating in certain businesses, it is especially important that the models that price insurance policies are fair and non-discriminatory. Black box models can make it very difficult to know which covariates are influencing the results, resulting in model risk and bias. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values enable interpretation of various black box models, but little progress has been made in two-part models. In this paper, we propose mSHAP (or multiplicative SHAP), a method for computing SHAP values of two-part models using the SHAP values of the individual models. This method will allow for the predictions of two-part models to be explained at an individual observation level. After developing mSHAP, we perform an in-depth simulation study. Although the kernelSHAP algorithm is also capable of computing approximate SHAP values for a two-part model, a comparison with our method demonstrates that mSHAP is exponentially faster. Ultimately, we apply mSHAP to a two-part ratemaking model for personal auto property damage insurance coverage. Additionally, an R package (mshap) is available to easily implement the method in a wide variety of applications. &lt;/font></description></item></channel></rss>
